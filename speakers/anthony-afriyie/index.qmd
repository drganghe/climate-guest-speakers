## About

The presentation will go over climate policy in practice. The talk will explore how climate policy is developed and implemented from advocacy and organizing then to government decision making and infrastructure investment. I hope to drawing on professional experience working at the intersection of public policy, community engagement, and climate related governance, the discussion will highlight the challenges of translating climate goals into real world outcomes, the importance of institutional design, and the skills needed to operate effectively across public, nonprofit, and political spaces.
