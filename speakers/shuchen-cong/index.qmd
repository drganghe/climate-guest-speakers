## About

Traditional energy poverty metrics like energy burden miss a critical vulnerability: households that reduce energy consumption to save money, often sacrificing comfort and health. This talk introduces the "energy equity gap" — a data-driven framework that quantifies when low-income households delay turning on heating or cooling compared to higher-income neighbors. Drawing from research across multiple climate zones and a pandemic-era survey of 2,000 households, we'll explore how energy limiting behavior manifests differently across regions, who gets left behind by current metrics, and how behavior-based approaches can inform more equitable energy assistance policies and climate adaptation strategies.

### Bio

Shuchen Cong is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Dartmouth's Irving Institute for Energy and Society and a Lecturer at the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies. Her research focuses on modeling the system-level impacts of residential and commercial energy behaviors, bridging micro-level decision-making with macro-level planning to inform energy system design and policy. At Dartmouth, she develops tools and frameworks that integrate household- and firm-level energy use patterns into broader models of grid resilience, reliability, and decarbonization.
