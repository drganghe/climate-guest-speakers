## Title

Perspectives on energy transition from industry: Renewables and energy storage


### Time

Monday, March 24, 2025    
6:00PM - 7:00PM ET

### Venue 
Online via zoom. Please [register](https://forms.gle/65hnhJPmnYaz5utG9) to participate.

## About

One of the most frequent criticisms leveled at renewable energy is its inherent intermittency.   Moreover, solar energy peaks around noon, whereas peak electricity demand is in the early evening. One way to mitigate intermittency and peak solar/load misalignment is to deploy energy storage. Energy storage can take many forms, from traditional pumped hydro to more recent electrochemical batteries. In this talk, we will address the drivers for battery energy storage system adoption, its economics and its benefits.
