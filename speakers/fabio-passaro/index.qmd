## About

Emissions from steel and cement industries continue to rise. It’s estimated that over 70% (1091 Mt/yr) of global coal-based blast furnace capacity will need reinvestment by 2030.  This presents a significant opportunity. Unlock the role policymakers have in mobilising private finance in ensuring a just transition in the steel and cement industries. Discover how credible transition plans are the means to access private capital for transition. 

Key points: 
 
- Gain an understanding of the net-zero transition in the steel and cement industries and why the G20 has put a strategic focus on them.  
- Explore the relevance of just transition plans and considerations in steel and cement.  
- Define what financial actors, companies and policymakers’ priorities are in this space.  
- Delve into the role that sustainable debt markets can play and how credible transition plans are critical to credible sustainability-linked bond (SLBs).
