## About

The U.S. energy mix—including natural gas, wind, solar, nuclear, and coal—plays a critical role in powering the economy. However, the resilience of these infrastructures is increasingly challenged by extreme weather events. Winter Storm Uri (2021), for example, exposed significant vulnerabilities in grid management and energy supply chains. As the nation moves toward decarbonization, ensuring grid resilience becomes not just a technical necessity but a public safety imperative. This talk explores how we can harness nature’s power to build a more resilient energy future. By leveraging subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) weather forecasts—particularly in the 2–5 week range—we can better anticipate and prepare for disruptive events. Integrating atmospheric dynamics into energy operations and planning offers a pathway to enhance safety, reliability, and sustainability. We will discuss strategies for embedding meteorological insights into industry routines, enabling proactive risk management and smarter grid adaptation.
