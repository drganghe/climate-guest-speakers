## Title

The Hidden Value of Carbon Capture and Storage: Assessing the Impact of CCS Projects on U.S. Housing Markets

### Time

Monday, September 30, 2024, 6:00PM - 7:00PM ET

### Venue 

Online via Zoom. Please [register](https://forms.gle/65hnhJPmnYaz5utG9) to participate.

## About

As our world seeks urgent solutions to reduce carbon emissions, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have emerged as a critical tool in our climate mitigation arsenal. This talk will begin with an essential overview of CCS - explaining what it is, how it works, and why it’s important. The discussion will then delve into insights from our recent study exploring the economic impacts of CCS projects on local communities, with a specific focus on how these facilities influence nearby property values in the United States.

### Bio

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the City University of New York, Baruch College.

I specialize in Energy Policy and Environmental Economics. A significant portion of my research has examined nonlinear electricity pricing, energy demand, renewable energy adoption (e.g., solar photovoltaics and home batteries), and local economic impacts of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in public policy (with a focus on energy economics) from the School of Public Policy University of Maryland.

My studies have been published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, and Resources, Conservation and Recycling. A number of my research papers have been presented at conferences such as NBER, AERE, APPAM, and USAEE.
