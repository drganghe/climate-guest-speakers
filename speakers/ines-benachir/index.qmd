## About

The presentation first offers an overview of photovoltaic (PV) systems and tracing their life cycle from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal or recycling. It highlights essential criteria for selecting PV panels, including efficiency, durability, and environmental impact. The role of EU regulations, such as the Ecodesign and WEEE Directives, is discussed in shaping sustainability across the sector. Key standards and guidelines that structure the EU market are also reviewed. The talk explores important considerations for conducting life cycle assessments (LCAs) and outlines challenges in comparing LCA results due to data quality and differing assumptions. It concludes with ongoing efforts to harmonize sustainability assessments and strengthen ecodesign criteria, aiming to support a more circular and environmentally responsible PV industry in Europe.
