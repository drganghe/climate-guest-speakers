## About

I will bring you on a journey from London to a tiny island, 7 square miles in the Atlantic ocean, to crazy days in Belfast and a meandering path to Cork, Ireland. I will share on my career, from labs, to sales, from contaminated land, water, calibration and then diverging into training. As a consultant in technical auditing, business development, sustainable development, data analytics, energy, and the circular economy. To where I am now, in a startup, on the cusp of the next big thing, being able to reuse used rechargeable batteries in a safe way, extending their life and avoiding carbon. Networking is something that comes easily, I am in many clubs, a Fellow of IEMA, a Toastmaster, a Climate Reality Leader and an EU pact ambassador. As a founding member of the global Sustainable Speakers Club, a Toastmaster International club that supports everyone interested in pursuing clarity in sustainable communication.
