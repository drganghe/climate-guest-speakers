## About

To meet global climate targets, rapid innovation in climate technologies is essential. Governments and firms are investing large resources to accelerate this process. Yet, tracking the development and scaling of climate technologies remains a challenge. Here, we show that machine learning can help track climate-tech innovation. We use large language models and LinkedIn data to construct a global network of key public and private organizations collaborating on climate-tech innovation. The resulting network encompasses 134,727 organizations across 189 countries. It includes diverse types of collaborations, such as R&D partnerships and equity investments, and spans 19 climate technologies.
