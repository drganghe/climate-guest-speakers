## Title

Evaluating environmental and climate impacts of low-carbon technologies to accelerate energy system decarbonization

### Time

Monday, October 28, 2024, 6:00PM - 7:00PM ET

### Venue 
Online via zoom. Please [register](https://forms.gle/65hnhJPmnYaz5utG9) to participate.

## About

The world cannot attain its climate goals by maintaining the current trajectory of carbon emissions. To achieve global carbon neutrality by 2050, the transition to affordable clean energy must be dramatically accelerated, posing both urgent challenges and opportunities. While electrification through renewable energy and non-fossil fuels is regarded as the most straightforward path to decarbonization, achieving a net-zero electricity system will require significant advances in technologies and cost reductions in energy storage. Additionally, for hard-to-abate sectors — such as aviation, shipping, steel and ammonia production — barriers and uncertainties remain regarding viable technological solutions and pathways. In this talk, Liqun Peng will present her research on evaluating environmental and climate implications of deploying low-carbon technologies to decarbonize energy systems by using multiple computational models and techno-economic analysis.

### Bio

Dr. Liqun Peng is a postdoctoral researcher in the Energy Technology Area at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Her research focuses on clean energy transition, energy and climate policies, power system modeling, and sustainability. She earned her PhD in Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy from Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs in January 2023. During her PhD, she employed interdisciplinary approaches, including optimization models, atmospheric chemistry models, and life cycle assessment, to quantify the trade-offs in deploying clean energy and low-carbon technologies, with a focus on energy transition, environmental impact and climate implications.
