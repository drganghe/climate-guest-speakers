## About

As both New York City and New York State pursue ambitious climate and energy goals, understanding the complexities of the city's electricity infrastructure has become increasingly critical. The NYC electricity grid operates within a unique regulatory framework that shapes how energy is generated, distributed, stored, and consumed across the five boroughs. With energy storage emerging as a key technology for integrating renewable energy, improving affordability, and enhancing grid resilience, its deployment will play a pivotal role in our collective transition to a cleaner energy future. Claudia will discuss the role of clean electricity in the energy transition, the history and operation of the NYC electricity grid, the electricity regulatory landscape, and the strategic role of energy storage technologies to support New York's pathway toward achieving a reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity grid.
