## About

Innovation originated in China has received growing international attention, yet there are many questions about the nature and models of Chinese innovation and its sustainability. Based on the experts’ analysis of ten major manufacturing sectors including traditional industries such as mechanical engineering, railroads, and automobiles; rapidly evolving and internationally highly integrated industries such as information-and communication-technology (ICT); and newly emerging sectors such as wind and solar energy, we learned that Chinese innovation is diverse across industries and enterprises and fluid over time. Nevertheless, key characteristics have emerged to compose of Chinese innovation models.
