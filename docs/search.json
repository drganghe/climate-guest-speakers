Modeling tools are essential for understanding the complex dynamics of energy systems, enabling us to evaluate pathways toward decarbonization. This talk explores how modeling can address three critical questions: (1) the cost-effectiveness and market potential of emerging decarbonization technologies, (2) the impact of policies on energy system transitions, and (3) the public health implications of clean energy transition. By integrating techno-economic, policy, and health impact analyses, these tools provide useful insights for designing effective decarbonization strategies."

    "section": "About",
    "text": "About\nThe world faces an unprecedented challenge: the dire consequences of climate change driven by excessive fossil fuel consumption. Alongside this, the SDG 7 - 2023 tracking report reveals that more than 675 million people still lack access to electricity, and a staggering 2.3 billion lack clean cooking facilities, predominantly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Without urgent action, an estimated 660 million will remain without electricity, and nearly 1.9 billion will lack clean cooking facilities by 2030.\nFurther, the Human Development Index recently experienced its first decline in over three decades, exacerbated by a series of societal challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Poverty and inequality have surged, deepening the divide. Energy challenges extend beyond the energy sector, impacting health, education, employment, water, food, and more. This interconnectedness not only heightens societal fragility but also risks sparking conflicts. This underscores the urgency of addressing these issues comprehensively and sustainably.\nThis talk will discuss how the current energy crisis offers an opportunity to accelerate the shift to renewable energy and create stable, secure, and equitable societies through accountable, effective, and inclusive governance. To succeed, we must establish the right institutional arrangements, policies, frameworks, technologies, and infrastructure for a system-wide transformation. It will present key action priorities and shed light on the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in crafting effective energy governance solutions for the 21st century."

We exploit the exogenous shock of the environmental documentary “Under the Dome” with a regression discontinuity design by using its release as the assignment and the number of days away from the release date as the running variable. Using longitudinal survey data collected in Nanjing, China, we find that “Under the Dome” increases people’s WTP for better air quality by 24.9%, which is equivalent to an increment of CNY 1226 per capita. Further analysis reveals that mass media affect people’s WTP by increasing their awareness of environmental pollution and level of risk perception. Our results also suggest that the documentary has a long-term effect."

    "text": "About\nEnergy, or precisely, “Clean Energy”, is at the centre of a highly active and dynamic field, which changes and affects not only our current life, but also our near future. Due to the importance Clean Energy currently possesses and its transitive characteristics: research, development, implementation, innovation, market penetration of clean energy technologies and systems have expanded in recent course of time. Energy systems have been in transition, extending their boundaries beyond the energy systems themselves. One of the challenging issues is the intermittent power generation and mismatching of energy supply and demand over a time scale when high renewable energy penetration takes place.\nThis calls for a new way to solve the challenging issues associated with new transitions of future clean energy systems with interdisciplinary and synthetic approach from not only the systematic overview, but also detailed components of clean energy systems. It needs to integrate the end-users load control with different energy saving approaches. It is location specific and highly tailored to serve its customers’ needs. This lecture addressed the transition of clean energy systems and illustrated, by an example, how an optimization solution can be achieved under the condition of high renewable energy penetration."

    "text": "About\nCompanies increasingly report their carbon emissions to demonstrate progress in reducing their carbon footprints—but do disclosures correspond to real reductions in emissions generated? I use research to quantify and understand the extent to which firm emissions reports disclosures are decoupled from actual emissions related to their energy purchases by distinguishing effective versus “non-additional” decarbonization strategies that can mislead stakeholders. This shows how firm strategy deflates reported emissions in response to pressures from both public policies directing firms to improve environmental performance, and from firm strategies like emissions targets.\nSome reporters appear to increase reported emissions by mistake, while others claim zero emissions—without reducing their reliance on carbon-intensive energy sources. These firms achieve environmental progress on paper, and may mean well, but fall short of intended impacts. These outcomes arise through a combination of incidental and strategic green wash that could deceive stakeholders and worsen the climate crisis, though results also suggest pathways to smarter, more effective decarbonization policies and strategies."

To achieve global carbon neutrality by 2050, the transition to affordable clean energy must be dramatically accelerated, posing both urgent challenges and opportunities. While electrification through renewable energy and non-fossil fuels is regarded as the most straightforward path to decarbonization, achieving a net-zero electricity system will require significant advances in technologies and cost reductions in energy storage. Additionally, for hard-to-abate sectors — such as aviation, shipping, steel and ammonia production — barriers and uncertainties remain regarding viable technological solutions and pathways. In this talk, Liqun Peng will present her research on evaluating environmental and climate implications of deploying low-carbon technologies to decarbonize energy systems by using multiple computational models and techno-economic analysis."

    "text": "About\nMeeting the goals of the Paris Agreement will require net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and substantial reductions before then. It will also require collaboration with China, which has emerged as the global leader in the mass production of low-carbon energy technologies (LCETs). In part because of China’s investments in manufacturing, the LCETs required to meet climate targets have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel sources (1). But some attribute China’s rapid rise in LCET sectors to unfair industrial policies—such as forced technology transfer requirements, massive subsidies, and outright intellectual property (IP) theft—aimed at strategically dominating the next generation of energy technologies (2). Trade relations between China and the world are currently unsettled, especially with the United States, a leading producer of both LCET research and development (R&D) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Against this backdrop, we outline why engaging with China is the more promising path to accelerate the global deployment of LCETs and to rapidly bring new technologies to mass production."

We conduct a systematic comparison of probabilistic technology cost forecasts produced by expert elicitation and model-based methods. We assess their performance by generating probabilistic cost forecasts of energy technologies rooted at various years in the past and then comparing these with observed costs in 2019. Model-based methods outperformed expert elicitations both in terms of capturing 2019 observed values and producing forecast medians that were closer to the observed values. However, all methods underestimated technological progress in almost all technologies. We also produce 2030 cost forecasts and find that elicitations generally yield narrower uncertainty ranges than model-based methods and that model-based forecasts are lower for more modular technologies."

It highlights essential criteria for selecting PV panels, including efficiency, durability, and environmental impact. The role of EU regulations, such as the Ecodesign and WEEE Directives, is discussed in shaping sustainability across the sector. Key standards and guidelines that structure the EU market are also reviewed. The talk explores important considerations for conducting life cycle assessments (LCAs) and outlines challenges in comparing LCA results due to data quality and differing assumptions. It concludes with ongoing efforts to harmonize sustainability assessments and strengthen ecodesign criteria, aiming to support a more circular and environmentally responsible PV industry in Europe."

I will also discuss a recent review on inequalities in access to electric vehicles and the associated infrastructure. For buildings, I will present work on the environmental and private economics of electrifying heating in buildings, as well as the effect of electrification on power system loads. Finally, I will present the preliminary results of a study that asks two questions: which energy efficiency retrofits are available to address high utility bills, and what are the energy cost burden impacts of air source heat pumps in existing homes across income groups? To answer these questions, I use empirical data from a pilot study of 50 homes in Michigan where higher than average energy cost burden rates, long heating season, and old housing stock pose concerning risks to human health and safety under this transition."

    "text": "About\nPublic research funding programs typically make grants with minimal intervention by program staff, rather than using a hands-on approach to project management, which is more common in the private sector. In contrast, program staff at the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) are given a set of real options with which to manage funded projects: abandon, contract or expand project budgets or timelines. Using internal data from ARPA-E, we show that active project management enables risk mitigation across a portfolio of research projects. We find that program staff modify projects frequently, especially project timelines, and these changes are more sensitive to poor performance than to strong performance. We also find that projects with a shortened timeline or reduced budget are less likely to generate short-term research outputs, compared to those of ultimately similar size. This evidence suggests that the practice of active project management, when combined with high upfront risk tolerance, can be used to enhance the productivity of mission-oriented public research funding."

    "text": "About\nThe U.S. energy mix—including natural gas, wind, solar, nuclear, and coal—plays a critical role in powering the economy. However, the resilience of these infrastructures is increasingly challenged by extreme weather events. Winter Storm Uri (2021), for example, exposed significant vulnerabilities in grid management and energy supply chains. As the nation moves toward decarbonization, ensuring grid resilience becomes not just a technical necessity but a public safety imperative. This talk explores how we can harness nature’s power to build a more resilient energy future. By leveraging subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) weather forecasts—particularly in the 2–5 week range—we can better anticipate and prepare for disruptive events. Integrating atmospheric dynamics into energy operations and planning offers a pathway to enhance safety, reliability, and sustainability. We will discuss strategies for embedding meteorological insights into industry routines, enabling proactive risk management and smarter grid adaptation."

    "text": "About\nAs energy and water are fundamentally intertwined, understanding the spatial and temporal evolution of thermoelectric water use and water stress is important for both sustainable energy development and water resource management. Here we compile high-resolution time-series (2000–2015) of water withdrawal and consumption inventories for China’s thermoelectric power sector to identify the driving forces behind changing water use patterns, and reveal the spatial distribution of thermoelectric water stress. We show that freshwater withdrawal has been decoupled from thermoelectric power generation growth at the national level due to the increased adoption of air-cooling and seawater-cooling technologies and advanced large generating units as well as water use efficiency improvements in this period. Nevertheless, the construction of large coal-fired power generation hubs has increased water stress in many arid and water-scarce catchments in northwestern regions of China. The westward development of the power industry necessitates water-withdrawal caps and the integration of water risk analysis into energy planning."

    "text": "Abstract\nCities and regional authorities play a crucial role in driving climate action to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Despite their critical importance, significant obstacles in data collection and variability in implementation complicate the assessment of their contributions. This study provides the largest analysis of climate efforts across more than 3,000 cities and 170 regions within the G20 nations, revealing a noticeable uptick in the adoption of medium- to long-term emissions reduction and net-zero targets post-2020. However, over 60% of these subnational entities are failing to meet their climate ambitions, with a larger percentage not achieving the reduction rates necessary to align with the 1.5°C goal. These findings underscore the pressing need for enhanced accountability mechanisms for subnational climate actions. Implementing standardized reporting and boosting transparency are pivotal steps to ensure that local and regional efforts substantively contribute to achieving both national and global climate objectives."

    "text": "About\nChina plays, and will likely continue to play, an indispensable role in research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) and manufacturing of low-carbon technologies that are necessary to address climate change. For example, China’s scale-up capabilities that are underpinned by manufacturing process improvements, supply chain optimization, and deep government support have contributed to substantial reductions in costs for mature technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) (1). However, the growing size of these economic sectors, coupled with national security concerns over the strong dependence on China in certain critical industries, has prompted policy-makers from Washington to Brussels to ask whether to alter course. Recognizing that economic and national security risks differ across technologies and the nature of a country’s integration with China, we highlight five primary risks to integration—separated into their economic and national security implications—and apply them to five leading low-carbon technologies: solar, wind, batteries, “green” steel, and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)."

    "text": "About\nThe penetration of renewable energies into our power systems has taken off drastically in recent years. Both utility-scale wind and solar farms as well as small-scale distributed energy resources (DERs), notably rooftop solar, are major ingredients of this transition. Related to the engineering solutions of compensating for the intermittency of renewable energies, a prominent concerning question is how should we pay the renewable energies, so that the integration of renewables can be sustained in the long run to reach the ambitious levels many countries and states are targeting. This talk will a) take an in-depth look into the current practice and its issues, b) provide a case study of what happens when peer-to-peer solar energy trading is implemented in a net-metered community, c) offer promising results on how we should pay renewables in bulk power markets."

Yet, tracking the development and scaling of climate technologies remains a challenge. Here, we show that machine learning can help track climate-tech innovation. We use large language models and LinkedIn data to construct a global network of key public and private organizations collaborating on climate-tech innovation. The resulting network encompasses 134,727 organizations across 189 countries. It includes diverse types of collaborations, such as R&D partnerships and equity investments, and spans 19 climate technologies."

    "text": "About\nEfforts to achieve decarbonization targets often fall short. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been used widely to assess current policies and quantify the additional efforts needed to close the gap. Yet, IAMs still lack adequate considerations of socio-political factors that are central to climate policy making. This makes them overly abstract and simplistic to inform concrete decisions by national and subnational policymakers. In this talk, I will discuss our research focused on three areas to make IAMs more decision-relevant: 1) enhancing policy realism by incorporating political economy insights on policy heterogeneity and instrument choice; 2) assessing winners and losers of climate policy by coupling IAMs with fine-scale impact assessment models; and 3) identifying equitable policy strategies by assessing multiple objectives under future uncertainties. I will demonstrate a range of modeling examples, from the cost of state-driven climate policy in the U.S. to the unintended health effects from a global carbon price."

    "text": "About\nThe rising demand for data processing and storage, driven by advancements in AI and large-scale computing, has raised concerns about the energy use and emissions profiles of new data centers in the U.S. and globally. With data centers in the U.S. rapidly expanding, their energy and emissions footprint will largely depend on the technologies and pathways adopted. Dr. Springer leads a report examines the geographical distribution, projected energy and emissions impacts, and state-level regulations affecting data center development, aiming to provide policymakers and stakeholders with insights to guide decisions on siting, construction, operations, and grid planning for low-carbon growth in computing demand. Dr. Springer will share her insights on the report."

    "text": "About\nTraditional energy poverty metrics like energy burden miss a critical vulnerability: households that reduce energy consumption to save money, often sacrificing comfort and health. This talk introduces the “energy equity gap” — a data-driven framework that quantifies when low-income households delay turning on heating or cooling compared to higher-income neighbors. Drawing from research across multiple climate zones and a pandemic-era survey of 2,000 households, we’ll explore how energy limiting behavior manifests differently across regions, who gets left behind by current metrics, and how behavior-based approaches can inform more equitable energy assistance policies and climate adaptation strategies."

    "section": "About",
    "text": "About\nSince the early 21st century, over 80% of major U.S. blackouts have been weather-related. Intensifying extreme events such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires, have nearly doubled weather-related outages in the past decade compared to the first decade of the century. Meanwhile, our energy sector, especially the electric power system, is becoming more exposed to the environment due to the large-scale integration of intermittent renewable energy such as solar and wind.\nConsidering this increasingly coupled climate-energy challenge, in this seminar, I discuss our recent research advancements in modeling, optimization, and socio-technical analysis of electricity grids towards climate resilience. Specifically, I cover topics including: (1) Grid modeling under extremes: quantifying cascading power outages with renewable integration under evolving hazards; (2) Grid optimization: enhancing grid resilience through coordinating transmission and distribution networks with large-scale distributed renewable integration; and (3) Social vulnerability: understanding community-level impacts and exploring opportunities for sustainability through microgrids. These topics will be illustrated through case studies of real-world power grids in Puerto Rico and NYC, highlighting the potential of resilience-oriented strategies to inform energy system planning and operation from grid operators to local communities."

Scaling-up energy supply chains rapidly while minimising life-cycle impacts requires aligning technology, markets and policies. STEER takes a systems approach that links engineering process models with supply and demand considerations to inform decision-making under uncertainty. Karan’s current work is focused on modeling graphite production. Previous work spans lithium, nickel, recycled plastics systems and Bayesian modeling to reduce uncertainity in material demand."

    "text": "About\nWhy are some Chinese cities more successful than others in initiating and implementing low-carbon policy actions? Despite being the world’s largest carbon emitter, China has committed to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Since the early 2010s, Beijing has selected over one hundred low-carbon pilot regions—from townships to cities to provinces—to explore policy solutions for decoupling economic growth from fossil-fuel use. In her new book, Implementing a Low-Carbon Future, Weila Gong finds variation in levels of low-carbon policy institutionalization across the case studies. This includes varying successes of the standards, regulations, and laws put into place through these policy experiments. Based on original research including extensive expert interviews, comparative case studies, and process tracing of the low-carbon policy experimentation in these pilot cities, Gong opens the black box of the subnational climate policy process in China’s centralized political system and identifies mid-level local bureaucrats as playing an essential “bridge leader” role in successful implementation despite changes in political leadership."
