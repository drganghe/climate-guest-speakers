Modeling tools are essential for understanding the complex dynamics of energy systems, enabling us to evaluate pathways toward decarbonization. This talk explores how modeling can address three critical questions: (1) the cost-effectiveness and market potential of emerging decarbonization technologies, (2) the impact of policies on energy system transitions, and (3) the public health implications of clean energy transition. By integrating techno-economic, policy, and health impact analyses, these tools provide useful insights for designing effective decarbonization strategies."

    "section": "About",
    "text": "About\nThe world faces an unprecedented challenge: the dire consequences of climate change driven by excessive fossil fuel consumption. Alongside this, the SDG 7 - 2023 tracking report reveals that more than 675 million people still lack access to electricity, and a staggering 2.3 billion lack clean cooking facilities, predominantly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Without urgent action, an estimated 660 million will remain without electricity, and nearly 1.9 billion will lack clean cooking facilities by 2030.\nFurther, the Human Development Index recently experienced its first decline in over three decades, exacerbated by a series of societal challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Poverty and inequality have surged, deepening the divide. Energy challenges extend beyond the energy sector, impacting health, education, employment, water, food, and more. This interconnectedness not only heightens societal fragility but also risks sparking conflicts. This underscores the urgency of addressing these issues comprehensively and sustainably.\nThis talk will discuss how the current energy crisis offers an opportunity to accelerate the shift to renewable energy and create stable, secure, and equitable societies through accountable, effective, and inclusive governance. To succeed, we must establish the right institutional arrangements, policies, frameworks, technologies, and infrastructure for a system-wide transformation. It will present key action priorities and shed light on the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in crafting effective energy governance solutions for the 21st century."

    "text": "About\nThis paper estimates the effect of mass media on public willingness to pay (WTP) for better environmental quality. We exploit the exogenous shock of the environmental documentary “Under the Dome” with a regression discontinuity design by using its release as the assignment and the number of days away from the release date as the running variable. Using longitudinal survey data collected in Nanjing, China, we find that “Under the Dome” increases people’s WTP for better air quality by 24.9%, which is equivalent to an increment of CNY 1226 per capita. Further analysis reveals that mass media affect people’s WTP by increasing their awareness of environmental pollution and level of risk perception. Our results also suggest that the documentary has a long-term effect."

    "text": "About\nEnergy, or precisely, “Clean Energy”, is at the centre of a highly active and dynamic field, which changes and affects not only our current life, but also our near future. Due to the importance Clean Energy currently possesses and its transitive characteristics: research, development, implementation, innovation, market penetration of clean energy technologies and systems have expanded in recent course of time. Energy systems have been in transition, extending their boundaries beyond the energy systems themselves. One of the challenging issues is the intermittent power generation and mismatching of energy supply and demand over a time scale when high renewable energy penetration takes place.\nThis calls for a new way to solve the challenging issues associated with new transitions of future clean energy systems with interdisciplinary and synthetic approach from not only the systematic overview, but also detailed components of clean energy systems. It needs to integrate the end-users load control with different energy saving approaches. It is location specific and highly tailored to serve its customers’ needs. This lecture addressed the transition of clean energy systems and illustrated, by an example, how an optimization solution can be achieved under the condition of high renewable energy penetration."

    "text": "About\nThe world cannot attain its climate goals by maintaining the current trajectory of carbon emissions. To achieve global carbon neutrality by 2050, the transition to affordable clean energy must be dramatically accelerated, posing both urgent challenges and opportunities. While electrification through renewable energy and non-fossil fuels is regarded as the most straightforward path to decarbonization, achieving a net-zero electricity system will require significant advances in technologies and cost reductions in energy storage. Additionally, for hard-to-abate sectors — such as aviation, shipping, steel and ammonia production — barriers and uncertainties remain regarding viable technological solutions and pathways. In this talk, Liqun Peng will present her research on evaluating environmental and climate implications of deploying low-carbon technologies to decarbonize energy systems by using multiple computational models and techno-economic analysis."

    "text": "About\nMeeting the goals of the Paris Agreement will require net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and substantial reductions before then. It will also require collaboration with China, which has emerged as the global leader in the mass production of low-carbon energy technologies (LCETs). In part because of China’s investments in manufacturing, the LCETs required to meet climate targets have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel sources (1). But some attribute China’s rapid rise in LCET sectors to unfair industrial policies—such as forced technology transfer requirements, massive subsidies, and outright intellectual property (IP) theft—aimed at strategically dominating the next generation of energy technologies (2). Trade relations between China and the world are currently unsettled, especially with the United States, a leading producer of both LCET research and development (R&D) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Against this backdrop, we outline why engaging with China is the more promising path to accelerate the global deployment of LCETs and to rapidly bring new technologies to mass production."

    "text": "About\nForecasting is essential to design efforts to address climate change. We conduct a systematic comparison of probabilistic technology cost forecasts produced by expert elicitation and model-based methods. We assess their performance by generating probabilistic cost forecasts of energy technologies rooted at various years in the past and then comparing these with observed costs in 2019. Model-based methods outperformed expert elicitations both in terms of capturing 2019 observed values and producing forecast medians that were closer to the observed values. However, all methods underestimated technological progress in almost all technologies. We also produce 2030 cost forecasts and find that elicitations generally yield narrower uncertainty ranges than model-based methods and that model-based forecasts are lower for more modular technologies."

It highlights essential criteria for selecting PV panels, including efficiency, durability, and environmental impact. The role of EU regulations, such as the Ecodesign and WEEE Directives, is discussed in shaping sustainability across the sector. Key standards and guidelines that structure the EU market are also reviewed. The talk explores important considerations for conducting life cycle assessments (LCAs) and outlines challenges in comparing LCA results due to data quality and differing assumptions. It concludes with ongoing efforts to harmonize sustainability assessments and strengthen ecodesign criteria, aiming to support a more circular and environmentally responsible PV industry in Europe."

I will also discuss a recent review on inequalities in access to electric vehicles and the associated infrastructure. For buildings, I will present work on the environmental and private economics of electrifying heating in buildings, as well as the effect of electrification on power system loads. Finally, I will present the preliminary results of a study that asks two questions: which energy efficiency retrofits are available to address high utility bills, and what are the energy cost burden impacts of air source heat pumps in existing homes across income groups? To answer these questions, I use empirical data from a pilot study of 50 homes in Michigan where higher than average energy cost burden rates, long heating season, and old housing stock pose concerning risks to human health and safety under this transition."

    "text": "About\nPublic research funding programs typically make grants with minimal intervention by program staff, rather than using a hands-on approach to project management, which is more common in the private sector. In contrast, program staff at the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) are given a set of real options with which to manage funded projects: abandon, contract or expand project budgets or timelines. Using internal data from ARPA-E, we show that active project management enables risk mitigation across a portfolio of research projects. We find that program staff modify projects frequently, especially project timelines, and these changes are more sensitive to poor performance than to strong performance. We also find that projects with a shortened timeline or reduced budget are less likely to generate short-term research outputs, compared to those of ultimately similar size. This evidence suggests that the practice of active project management, when combined with high upfront risk tolerance, can be used to enhance the productivity of mission-oriented public research funding."

    "text": "About\nNatural gas (NG), considered a bridging fuel for a low-carbon future, has become a major component of the global energy system, requiring extensive underground pipeline infrastructure. Fugitive methane (CH₄) emissions from pipeline leaks pose environmental, safety, and economic risks. Effective leak detection and quantification (LDAQ) methods are crucial for identifying leaks, assessing their magnitude, and ensuring timely mitigation.\nHowever, gaps remain in LDAQ survey methods, and their effectiveness is not well understood. This talk explores optimizing LDAQ protocols by refining key parameters—including survey speed, altitude, and distance downwind from leak sources—using CFD 3D plume modeling and field measurements across diverse environmental conditions. The results provide a physical basis for operators and solution providers to determine optimal survey parameters under varying environmental conditions."

    "text": "About\nAs energy and water are fundamentally intertwined, understanding the spatial and temporal evolution of thermoelectric water use and water stress is important for both sustainable energy development and water resource management. Here we compile high-resolution time-series (2000–2015) of water withdrawal and consumption inventories for China’s thermoelectric power sector to identify the driving forces behind changing water use patterns, and reveal the spatial distribution of thermoelectric water stress. We show that freshwater withdrawal has been decoupled from thermoelectric power generation growth at the national level due to the increased adoption of air-cooling and seawater-cooling technologies and advanced large generating units as well as water use efficiency improvements in this period. Nevertheless, the construction of large coal-fired power generation hubs has increased water stress in many arid and water-scarce catchments in northwestern regions of China. The westward development of the power industry necessitates water-withdrawal caps and the integration of water risk analysis into energy planning."

    "text": "Abstract\nCities and regional authorities play a crucial role in driving climate action to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Despite their critical importance, significant obstacles in data collection and variability in implementation complicate the assessment of their contributions. This study provides the largest analysis of climate efforts across more than 3,000 cities and 170 regions within the G20 nations, revealing a noticeable uptick in the adoption of medium- to long-term emissions reduction and net-zero targets post-2020. However, over 60% of these subnational entities are failing to meet their climate ambitions, with a larger percentage not achieving the reduction rates necessary to align with the 1.5°C goal. These findings underscore the pressing need for enhanced accountability mechanisms for subnational climate actions. Implementing standardized reporting and boosting transparency are pivotal steps to ensure that local and regional efforts substantively contribute to achieving both national and global climate objectives."

    "text": "About\nChina plays, and will likely continue to play, an indispensable role in research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) and manufacturing of low-carbon technologies that are necessary to address climate change. For example, China’s scale-up capabilities that are underpinned by manufacturing process improvements, supply chain optimization, and deep government support have contributed to substantial reductions in costs for mature technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) (1). However, the growing size of these economic sectors, coupled with national security concerns over the strong dependence on China in certain critical industries, has prompted policy-makers from Washington to Brussels to ask whether to alter course. Recognizing that economic and national security risks differ across technologies and the nature of a country’s integration with China, we highlight five primary risks to integration—separated into their economic and national security implications—and apply them to five leading low-carbon technologies: solar, wind, batteries, “green” steel, and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)."

Both utility-scale wind and solar farms as well as small-scale distributed energy resources (DERs), notably rooftop solar, are major ingredients of this transition. Related to the engineering solutions of compensating for the intermittency of renewable energies, a prominent concerning question is how should we pay the renewable energies, so that the integration of renewables can be sustained in the long run to reach the ambitious levels many countries and states are targeting. This talk will a) take an in-depth look into the current practice and its issues, b) provide a case study of what happens when peer-to-peer solar energy trading is implemented in a net-metered community, c) offer promising results on how we should pay renewables in bulk power markets."

    "text": "About\nTo meet global climate targets, rapid innovation in climate technologies is essential. Governments and firms are investing large resources to accelerate this process. Yet, tracking the development and scaling of climate technologies remains a challenge. Here, we show that machine learning can help track climate-tech innovation. We use large language models and LinkedIn data to construct a global network of key public and private organizations collaborating on climate-tech innovation. The resulting network encompasses 134,727 organizations across 189 countries. It includes diverse types of collaborations, such as R&D partnerships and equity investments, and spans 19 climate technologies."

My journey from designing energy-efficient buildings in Iran to advocating for energy justice in the U.S. illustrates how career paths can evolve in unexpected yet rewarding ways. My work now focuses on how local governments and investor-owned utilities can integrate energy justice into their operations. In my talk, I’ll share insights from my career transition, the challenges and motivations behind it, and my experiences on the Sustainability Advisory Board in Lawrence, Kansas. I’ll also discuss my ongoing research, which investigates the incorporation of social equity in energy planning. My story emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, community engagement, and persistence in driving meaningful change in the field of energy and climate policy."

    "text": "About\nEfforts to achieve decarbonization targets often fall short. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been used widely to assess current policies and quantify the additional efforts needed to close the gap. Yet, IAMs still lack adequate considerations of socio-political factors that are central to climate policy making. This makes them overly abstract and simplistic to inform concrete decisions by national and subnational policymakers. In this talk, I will discuss our research focused on three areas to make IAMs more decision-relevant: 1) enhancing policy realism by incorporating political economy insights on policy heterogeneity and instrument choice; 2) assessing winners and losers of climate policy by coupling IAMs with fine-scale impact assessment models; and 3) identifying equitable policy strategies by assessing multiple objectives under future uncertainties. I will demonstrate a range of modeling examples, from the cost of state-driven climate policy in the U.S. to the unintended health effects from a global carbon price."
